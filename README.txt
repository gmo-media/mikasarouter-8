Documentation
-------------

For further information about MySQL or additional documentation, see:

* http://www.mysql.com
* http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-router/en/

You can browse the MySQL Router Reference Manual online or download it
in any of several formats at the URL given earlier in this file.
Source distributions include a local copy of the manual in the
Docs directory.

Developer documentation can be build when Doxygen 1.8.9 or greater
has been installed:

    shell> cd build
    shell> cmake ..
    shell> make doc

You can then open the folder `doc/html/index.html` in your browser.


Coverage information
--------------------

To build so that coverage information is generated:

    cmake <path-to-source> -DENABLE_COVERAGE=1

To get coverage information, just run the program or the unit tests
(do not forget to enable the unit tests if you want to run them). Once
you have collected coverage information, you can generate an HTML
report in `<build-dir>/coverage/html` using:

    make coverage-html

There are three variables to control where the information is
collected and where the reports are written:

- `GCOV_BASE_DIR` is a cache variable with the full path to a base
  directory for the coverage information.

  It defaults to `${CMAKE_BUILD_DIR}/coverage`.

- `GCOV_INFO_FILE` is a cache varible with the full path to the info
  file for the collected coverage information.

  It defaults to `${GCOV_BASE_DIR}/coverage.info`.

- `GCOV_XML_FILE` is a cache varible with the full path to the XML
  file for the collected coverage information.

  It defaults to `${GCOV_BASE_DIR}/coverage.xml`.

- `GCOV_HTML_DIR` is a cache variable with the full path to the
  directory where the HTML coverage report will be generated.

  It defaults to `${GCOV_BASE_DIR}/html`.
